# Future Issues
- User profile
- Login/Register
- Scanner page for symbols based on indicators and such
- Comparison tools to other tickers
- Portfolio page, show p&l, ratios, dividends, anything a user wants to know.
- Individual ticker page to show indicators, ongoing p&l, etc...
- Backtesting reports page, choose symbol and create a report over that symbol on time
- Automatic bots page, paper vs real trading
- Strategies page
   - varying levels of strategies from deep learning models, ml models, basic, etc..
   - ability to make easy strategies like selecting criteria of EMA, RSI, entry/exits.
